                <div class="col-md-6 right-top">
                    <p class="lead">Website performance optimization is something that should be top priority,
                        especially when there is so much online competition. Websites are getting slower, internet uses
                        a colossal amount of electricity and content on the websites is less interesting and efficient
                        then ever. <br>
                        Web engineers have therefore discussed on the different ways to create sustainable websites
                        where performance optimization is mandatory. This section will thus discuss on the different
                        priorities and the ways to change how web deigners work.

                <strong> <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/" target="_blank">Sustainability and page
                        speed</a></strong>
                go hand-in-hand. When your website runs more efficiently, one uses
                less processing power, which means that the wepbpage uses less energy and will have a lower carbon
                footprint. Customers expect to get the content they want instantaneously, and pages
                load more quickly, reducing a site's bounce rate and keeping customers engaged and satisfied.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-weight-light">User Interface - ane efficient content</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                <strong> <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2019/03/05/mobile-first-design-for-2019/"
                        target="_blank">Sustainable design</a>
                </strong>
                is a design that is efficient and accessible. Creating good experiences for both
                mobile and desktop users improves accessibility as it makes it easy for people to access your
                site no matter what hardware they have. Mobile-first web design also helps you avoid loading large
                assets designed for desktop machines, which improves your site's speed and energy efficiency.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Consequences of non sustainable pages</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                <strong><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/save-planet-improving-website-performance/"
                        target="_blank">Internet</a></strong>
                uses a colossal amount of electricity. In most countries, this electricity is produced
                by burning of fossil fuels. This, in turn, means that the Internet’s carbon footprint has grown
                to the point where it may have eclipsed global air travel, and this makes the Internet the
                largest coal-fired machine on Earth.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Findability</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                The easier the content is to find, the fewer pages a user has to load to locate information. This means
                fewer server requests are made and that unnecessary page elements — like photos and videos, which take
                up a lot of bandwidth — don’t load, either. These small energy savings accumulate over time.

            <h1 class="font-weight-light">Linking Perfomance Optimization and sustainability</h1>
            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Frontend Optimization</h4>
            <p class="lead">Here are a set of questions a developer should pay attention to when redesigning his
                website:
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class="lead"> What deserves or need to be on the homepage? </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="lead"> What's the real value of each element of the homepage? </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="lead"> Is this element (e.g. nav-bar) here because it has a real purpose, or is it
                            by convetion because a website without a nav-bar doesn't have its place? </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Furthermore, here are two examples of actions a web developer should do in order to optimize
                a <strong> <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank">
                        website's
                        sustainability</a></strong>
            </p>
            <ol>

                <li class="lead"> <strong><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/reduce-http-requests"
                            target="_blank">Reduce
                            network
                            requests</a></strong> </li>

                <p class="lead">Control every http requests by checking if they are necessary, thus can we avoid
                    unnecesssary loading and reloading. <br>
                    Check all the images to see if they are really enhancing the user experience, check also the
                    format, is it suitable and sustainable?<br>
                    Check if embedding a video is really necessary; if only a fraction of the users are actually
                    going to sit and watch the embedded video, isn't it more sustainable to add a link instead?
                </p>
                <li class="lead"> <strong> <a
                            href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/website-optimization/"
                            target="_blank">Scrutinise evrything :</a></strong>
                    Scrutinise everything : interrogate every aspect of the pages</li>
                <p class="lead">Check if all the elements are really adding something to the webpage; or do we add
                    something because convenient dictates that? <br>
                    Pages should be stripped down to litteraly the bare essentials with additional content only
                    being loaded at the user’s explicit request. <br>
                    Use CSS properly, every character represents a byte and even when compressed,they’re still
                    taking up weight. Classes, ID and the rest should be well monitored.
                </p>
            </ol>
            <p class="lead">Finally, here are some targets to achieve in order to render better sustainable websites.
            </p> <br>
            <h6 class="lead"><strong> &nbsp
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
