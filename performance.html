                    <h4>Page speed and Sustainability</h4>
                    <p>Sustainability and page speed go hand-in-hand. When your website runs more efficiently, you use
                        less
                        processing power, which means that your site uses less energy and will have a lower carbon
                        footprint.
                        Your customers expect to get the content they want instantaneously, and efficient pages load
                        more
                        quickly, reducing your site's bounce rate and keeping customers engaged and satisfied.</p> <br>

                    <h4>Unser Interface - a sustainable design required</h4>
                    <p>Sustainable design is design that is efficient and accessible. Creating good experiences for both
                        mobile
                        and desktop users improves accessibility because it makes it easy for people to access your site
                        no
                        matter what hardware they have. Mobile-first web design also helps you avoid loading large
                        assets
                        designed for desktop machines, which improves your site's speed and energy efficiency.</p> <br>

                    <h4>Consequences of non sustainable pages</h4>
                    <p>Internet uses a colossal amount of electricity. In most countries, this electricity is produced
                        by burning of fossil fuels. This, in turn, means that the Internet’s carbon footprint has grown
                        to the point where it may have eclipsed global air travel, and this makes the Internet the
                        largest coal-fired machine on Earth.</p>

            <h2>They keys to a successful sustainable web design</h2>
            <p>When optimizing a web page, it makes it usually ore sustainable, more performant, and generally it
                has a better user experience too. However, how can a user know if a website is sustainable? The key
                metric for measuring the sustainability of a digital product is its energy usage. This includes the
                work done by the server, the client and the intermediary communications networks that transmit data
                between the two.</p> <br>
            <p>If we’re doing a complete redesign of a website, or starting a new one from scratch, we can start
                with some really high-level questions here. For example, what actually deserves or needs to be on a
                homepage? And more specifically, what value does each element on a homepage bring?</p> <br>
            <h5>There are some sets of questions that help when redesigning a website to ensure it is sustainable
            </h5>
            <p>For example: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What deserves or need to be on the homepage?</li>
                <li>What value does each element of the homepage bring?</li>
                <li>Is this element (e.g. nav-bar) here because it has a real purpose, or is it by convetion
                    because a website without a nav-bar doesn't have its place? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Furthermore, here are two examples of actions a web developer should do in order to have a
                sustainable website: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce network requests</li>
                <p>Control every http requests by checking if they are necessary, thus can we avoid unnecesssary
                    loading and reloading. <br>
                    Check all the images to see if they are really enhancing hte user experience, check also the
                    format, is it suitable and sustainable?<br>
                    Check if embedding a video is really necessary; if only a fraction of the users are actually
                    going to sit and watch the embedded video, isn't it better to add a link instead?
                </p>
                <li>Scrutinise evrything : interrogate every aspect of the pages</li>
                <p>Check if all the elemnts are really adding something to the webpage; or do we put something
                    because convenient dictates that? <br>
                    Pages should be stripped down to litteraly the bare essentials with additional content only
                    being loaded at the user’s explicit request. <br>
                    Use CSS properly, every character represents a byte and even when compressed,they’re still
                    taking up weight. Classes, ID and the rest should be well monitored.
                </p>
            </ol>
            <p>Finally, here are some targets to achieve in order torender a better sustainable website.</p>
            <h6 class="finalWord">MORE PERFORMANT &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp MORE USER FRIENDLY &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                MORE ACCESSIBLE
                &nbsp
                &nbsp &nbsp
                &nbsp MORE SERVER
                FRIENDLY</h6>
