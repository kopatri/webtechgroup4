        		      <p class="lead">SEO stands for search engine optimization, and it is a practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic 
        	           to your website through organic search engine results. Good search engine optimization can improve search engine rankings, 
         	           which is not only a good marketing practice but also a sustainable choice because they consume less front-end energy. 
        	           In other words, better SEO/search on site = content found more quickly = less energy used = more sustainable. 
        	            Here are some effective SEO strategies. </p>
        	        </div>

            <h1 class="display-4">Keyword Research</h1>
            <p class="lead">Everything in search engine optimization revolves around keywords. This is why keyword research is usually the first step in an SEO strategy. Keyword research can help you understand your target market and audience and how they search for your content, services, or products. Through keyword research, you can know what people are looking for, how many people are searching, and what format of information they want?
              Keyword research first needs to discover keywords. You can enter the keywords you think of related to your product or website into the keyword research tool to find search volume and similar keywords. That information can help you prioritize keywords and choose the keywords that can bring the greatest strategic advantage to your website.
              After finding the search terms related to your website, you can make you more strategic by looking at your competitors and figuring out that the search may be different depending on the season or location. It may be a good idea to prioritize high-volume keywords that are not currently ranked by competitors. Besides, understanding seasonal trends can be helpful for setting content strategies. By narrowing your keyword research to specific towns, counties, or states in Google Keyword Planner, or evaluating "interests by region" in Google Trends, you can strategically target specific locations. Location-specific research can help make your content more relevant to your target audience.

             <h1 class="display-4">Improved Headline</h1>
             <p class="lead">An attractive headline can attract visitors and increase website traffic. You should accurately describe the content of the page, choose a headline that reads naturally, and effectively convey the subject of the page content.</p>
             <p class="lead">The following are some of the tips to optimize headlines:</p>
             <ul>
             	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Place your keyword towards the end of the headline</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Do not extend your headline beyond 60 characters</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Use a descriptive title</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Use eye-catching words</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Have numbers–it increases the chances of more clicks</strong></p></li>
             </ul>
             <p class="lead">In order to improve the headline, we should avoid the following wrong practices. 1. Choose a title that has nothing to do with the content of the page and use the default or fuzzy title, such as "Untitled" or "New Page 1". 2. Use a title on all pages or a large group of pages on your website. Ideally, every page on your website should have a unique title to help Google know the difference between that page and other pages on your website.</p>
             <h1 class="display-4">Meta Description</h1>
        	 <p>
        	 	<img class="img-responsive center-block" id="meta-description" src="images/meta-description.gif" >
        	 </p>
             <p class="lead">Meta descriptions are also important, mainly because they also attract users’ attention and affect click-through rates. A page's description meta tag gives Google and other search engines a summary of what the page is about. A page's title maybe a few words or a phrase, whereas a page's description meta tag might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. Like the &lt;title&gt; tag, the description &lt;meta&gt; tag is placed within the &lt;head&gt; element of your HTML document.</p>
             <p class="lead"> The best practice is to accurately summarize the content of the page. Although the text in the description meta tag does not have a minimum or maximum length, if you want to avoid the risk of being truncated, your meta description must not exceed 155 characters. Therefore, it is best to use the <a href="https://serpsim.com/">SERP pixel tool</a>  to ensure that the title will not be cut. Besides, a unique description is used for each page, and each page has a different description meta tag, which is helpful to users and Google.</p>
             <h1 class="display-4">Video Content</h1>
             <p class="lead">Video has become the most popular form of content. With the help of videos, you can connect more deeply with users. By adding videos to your website, you can attract a lot of traffic.</p>
             <p class="lead">The following are some tips for optimization:</p>
             <ul>
             	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Put your keyword in the title and filename</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Place a link to your website within the first two sentences of your description</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Put a transcript in the video description</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Place a link to other videos in your channel within your description</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Use timestamps within your video</strong></p></li>
            	<li><p class="lead"><strong>Tag with keywords and related video</strong></p> </li>
             </ul>
        </div>
