                        approach</a></strong>
                to ensuring environmental sustainability consists of several elements. Their
                environmental sustainability programme, advanced in 2019, aims to mitigate greenhouse gas emission,
                enhances water management practices, manages water consumption and resilience. Furthermore, Paypal
                complies with international standards like ISO 4001 to enhance environmental management systems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                According to financial health and climate justices' principles, Paypal believes that financial security
                is essential for communities which have suffered due to extreme weather disasters. Therefore, Paypal
                uses its technology and financial standing to fund peers which were impacted by extreme weather
                conditions. Indeed, PayPal provides payment solutions which counteract against a warming planet.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                In compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement, PayPal reduces company-wide greenhouse gas emissions.
                For instance, they replaced inefficient lighting with LED technology. Compared to 2018, Paypal reduced
                its greenhouse gas emissions emission by 10%. In 2019, 65% of used energy came from renewable sources.
                PayPal aims to reach the goal of 100% renewable energy usage by its data centres to be achieved by 2023.

            <p class="lead">
                In 2019, PayPal has set up resilient water management by measuring its consumption. Indeed, PayPal is
                not in a water-intense business sector. Nevertheless, they consume water and efficiently monitor
                consumption for cooling purposes in their data centres.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Besides their initial business of payment processing, Paypal introduced other services supporting their
                environmental goals. Due to the introduction of <strong> <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://shop.izettle.com/gb/">iZettle
                        Ocean Reader</a></strong>, they
                launched a card reader which is created from recycled ocean plastics. Moreover, PayPal invests in
                <strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://happyreturns.com/">Happy Returns</a></strong> which redefines
                the scope of
                logistics by reusables packaging and
                aggregated return shipping.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                For waste management purposes, PayPal installed company-wide several recycling programs. In the first
                stances, it focusses on a strategy to prevent electronic waste. Currently, 300 metrics tons of IT
                hardware were refurbished and reused. The other part was given to recycling. Moreover, PayPal cooperates
                with local providers to establish food waste composting stations.

            <h1 class="font-weight-light">Stripe</h1>

                provides with its solution stripe climate an interesting alternative for payment processing. They
                promise to direct a portion of their revenue to companies developing carbon removal technologies. During
                the payment process, their application shows the customer that 1% of their purchase will be used to
                remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Indeed, companies can implement Stripe solutions and Stripe will support projects which conduct carbon
                removal. Due to Stripe badges during the payment process and the possibility to implement corresponding
                badges on company websites which use Stripe, the customer will recognize the environmental commitment.
                Currently, Stripe Climate is only available in the US, but they will expand to further countries.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Stripe aims to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5Â°C. For this, they motivate business
                to use their payment solution as early developers and sink the cost curve for developing carbon removal
                technology. With increasing volume, carbon dioxide reducing technologies become more affordable for the
                mass of customers
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Stripe works with scientific advisers to find the most promising carbon dioxide removal technologies.
                For instance, <strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.climeworks.com/ ">climeworks</a></strong> is
                a project which uses renewable geothermal energy and waste heat catching
                carbon dioxide from the air and sequester it permanently to underground rocks. Another project is called
                <strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://projectvesta.org/">Project Vesta</a></strong>
                which captures carbon dioxide by using a mineral called olivine. When ocean waves scratch
                olivine, it breaks down and captures carbon dioxide from the sea and reforms it to limestone at the
                water ground.

            <h1 class="font-weight-light">Cryptocurrencies as alternative</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                From sustainable environment view, the use of bitcoin as a payment solution is not a good alternative.
                In 2019, it was estimated that the bitcoin network consumes more energy than the entire nation of

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Nevertheless, there is a greener alternative in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For instance, Nano
