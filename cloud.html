					<p class="lead">Selecting a public cloud provider for a web application is a challenging task which is
                        dictated by project-specific variables and considerations. As such, the purpose of this section is not
                        to provide a general framework through which the optimal public cloud provider can be selected for a
                        given project. Instead, we hope to provide web developers with a foundational understanding of the
                        principles which underpin public cloud sustainability in addition to the unique approaches to
                        sustainability adopted by the largest global public cloud providers. We encourage developers to consider
                        these sustainable principles throughout the public cloud decision making process</p>

    <h1 class="font-weight-light">Corporate Digital Responsibility at a Glance</h1>
    <p class="lead">Our research into the sustainability initiatives and policies of major cloud providers can be summarised as follows: </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">If water preservation and zero-waste are important for your team or project, then Microsoft Azure is worth looking into.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If your project relies on ML/AI and/or requires large storage capabilities, then the policies and technologies pust forth by Google Cloud may be of interest.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you value sustainability derived from efficiency and renewable energy use, then Amazon Web Services may align with your goals.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">If you are invested in the concept of the circular economy, the policies put forth by Microsoft Azure and Oracle cloud may be aligned with your values.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Out of all American public cloud providers surveyed, Oracle Cloud has set the least ambitions sustainability targets.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud have not set clear sustainability targets in the way that AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have. A key policy difference between Chinese and American public cloud providers is the fact that American cloud providers have developed sustainability initiatives across datacenters whereas Chinese public cloud providers have a narrower focus, developing policies on the datacenter-level.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 class="font-weight-light">Amazon Web Services</h1>
    <p class="lead">Amazon Web Services have shaped their sustainability strategy around three key principles:
        renewable energy, datacenter efficiency, and water use. In the context of renewable energy, AWS have
        pledged to shift 100% of datacenter energy usage to renewable sources by 2025. From an efficiency
        standpoint, the economies of scale which AWS leverages enables the firm to operate datacenters 3.6x more
        efficiently than the average US datacenters. Although AWS has not specifically committed to a water
        conservation target, the firm currently operates four major datacenter water conservation initiatives.
        Finally, AWS actively support the sustainability community by providing “innovators and researchers” in
        the sustainability field with relevant tools and datasets to incentivize progress. For more information,
        please read the <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/the-cloud" target="_blank">AWS guide to
            cloud sustainability</a>.</p>
    
    <h1 class="font-weight-light">Microsoft Azure</h1>
    <p class="lead">Microsoft Azure have shaped their sustainability strategy around four key principles:
        renewable energy, water use, zero waste, and net zero. Similarly to Amazon, Microsoft Azure have pledged
        to shift 100% of datacenter energy usage to renewable sources by 2025. The first key differentiator
        between the sustainable policies of Microsoft Azure and AWS is that Microsoft has publicly committed to
        running “water-positive” cloud operations by 2030. Microsoft Azure additionally differentiates itself
        from Amazon by aiming to operate “zero-waste” datacenters by 2030 while also focusing on “net zero” data
        center construction processes. As such, if water-positive or zero-waste operations are important
        sustainability factors for your project or team Microsoft Azure may be worth having a closer look at.
        For more information, please read the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/global-infrastructure/sustainability/" target="_blank">Azure guide to cloud
            sustainability</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="font-weight-light">Google Cloud Platform</h1>
    <p class="lead">GCP have shaped their sustainability strategy around three key principles: renewable energy,
        machine learning efficiency, and storage efficiency. Google claims that GCP datacenters have been
        powered by 100% renewable energy since 2017. The validity of this claim is suspect as it is predicated
        on the idea that GCP matches “electricity consumption” with renewable “energy purchases”. The company
        has stated that full-scale decarbonization across the Google Cloud Platform will occur by 2030. As such,
        GCP appears to be five years behind both AWS and Microsoft Azure in the context of shifting datacenter
        electricity utilization to renewable energy sources. However, Google differentiates itself from AWS and
        Microsoft Azure through its energy efficient machine learning and data storage technologies. As such, if
        AI/ML or big data storage operations are important factors for your project or team Google Cloud may be
        worth having a closer look at. For more information, please read the <a
            href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform guide to cloud
            sustainability</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="font-weight-light">Oracle Cloud</h1>
    <p class="lead">Oracle Cloud have shaped their sustainability strategy around three key principles:
        renewable energy, efficiency, and the circular economy. In the context of efficiency, Oracle Cloud
        express a similar set of arguments when compared to AWS: the economies of scale at the core of cloud
        infrastructure enable energy efficiency gains which are not possible in on-premise or dedicated
        datacenters. When compared to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP the goals which Oracle has set are
        relatively modest. Oracle has pledged to “reduce emissions generated per unit of energy” by 55% and
        “reduce absolute emissions across […] Oracle Cloud data centers” by 26% prior to 2025. Finally, Oracle
        has a similar waste minimization strategy to Microsoft Azure which is predicated on the circular economy
        model, however Oracle falls short of setting the aggressive zero-waste goals which Microsoft has
        publicly set for Azure. For more information, please read the <a
            href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/citizenship/sustainability/clean-cloud.html" target="_blank">Oracle Cloud
            guide to cloud sustainability</a>.</p>
        
    <h1 class="font-weight-light">Tencent Cloud</h1>
    <p class="lead">Tencent Cloud have shaped their sustainability strategy around three key principles:
        renewable energy, power usage effectiveness, and “carbon footprint” minimization through “energy
        recycling”. The Tencent approach to cloud sustainability differs from that of the US-based cloud
        providers in two key ways. Firstly, Tencent has not committed to explicit, objective sustainability
        goals. Secondly, Tencent approaches sustainability on the individual datacenter level whereas the
        US-based cloud providers have a tendency to set policies which span across all datacenters. For more
        information, please read the <a
            href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/global-infrastructure/sustainability" target="_blank">Tencent guide to cloud
            sustainability</a>.</p>
    
    <h1 class="font-weight-light">Alibaba Cloud</h1>
    <p class="lead">Alibaba Cloud have shaped their sustainability strategy around two key principles: renewable
        energy and power usage effectiveness. It is imperative to note that, among the six public cloud
        providers analyzed in this section, Alibaba Cloud provides the least transparency in terms of ongoing
        cloud sustainability initiatives. Quite similarly to Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud has not committed to
        explicit sustainability goals and develops sustainability initiatives at the datacenter level. <a
